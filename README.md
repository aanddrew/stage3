Hello all.


This is a little project I've been working on to teach myself OpenGL.

[Here's a video showcasing the project.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jme4-1odv0M)


It is a 3d graphics engine that uses SDL and OpenGL.


So far there is not much here. I am going to use this engine to accompany a 3d game
that I will make this summer.

It has very basic functionality. You can draw meshes which are loaded from .obj
files using your own textures.

I plan on expanding this so that I can use it in many different projects in the 
future. I will definitely add some documentation at some point.

Here's some screenshots.

This is what you see upon entering the example.cpp

These are just other ones
